Crystals Collector Game

This project was developed by a student learning the javaScript and jQuery programming languages.

Creating this game gave the developer jQuery and javaScript coding experience. 

This project is useful because it combines many javaScript and jQuery concepts in practical ways. 
The game is also interesting to play.
 
Here's how a game is played:

1. There will be four crystals displayed as buttons in the lower portion of the page. 

2. The player is shown a random number at the start of each game. This game number is located in the middle of the page in the green box.

3. When the player clicks on a crystal, the game adds that crystal's points to the player's total score. Each crystal can have a point value of (1 - 12) points. Each crystal's point value will not change during a game. The player's total score box is located in the gray box at the bottom of the page. 

4. A player wins a game if their total score matches the game's number. 

5. A player loses a game if their total score exceeds the game's number.   

6. The game restarts whenever a player wins or loses. 

    A new game number is shown at the start of each new game. 
    
    Each crystal's assigned point value may change at the start of each new game. 

Currently, only the original developer maintains and contributes to this project.
